### What I Build

I bring the full vision to life, from the foundational engine to the final user experience:

- **Resilient & Scalable Backends:** Building the powerful, reliable core of any product.
- **Intelligent Data Layers:** Creating the brains behind the operation, uncovering insights and enabling smart features.
- **Modern Web Experiences:** Delivering fast, interactive web apps and dashboards that users love.
- **Seamless Native Apps:** Bringing products directly into users' hands with beautiful, native experiences.

I'm always open to collaborating on exciting ventures or helping founders turn their vision into reality.
