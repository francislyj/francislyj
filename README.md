# Hi, I'm Francis ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent software creator and freelance engineer, passionate about transforming ambitious ideas into tangible, end-to-end digital products. My approach is simple: use the right tool for the right job to build systems that are not only powerful and scalable, but also delightful to use.

### ðŸš€ My Architectural Blueprint

I'm building a versatile and robust ecosystem where each technology plays a strategic role. This is the blueprint for my future creations:

#### **The Core Engine (Go)**
The foundation of my services. I use Go to build high-performance, concurrent, and scalable microservices. This is where reliability and speed are paramount, forming the unbreakable backbone of every product.
*(Microservices, gRPC, REST APIs, Gin, `ent`)*

#### **The Intelligence Layer (Python)**
Data is the new currency. I leverage Python for everything related to AI, machine learning, and data analytics. This layer is responsible for uncovering insights, powering smart features, and making products intelligent.
*(Data Science, ML, AI Services)*

#### **The Web Experience (Node.js & TypeScript)**
For crafting fast, modern, and interactive web applications. From elegant user-facing websites to complex admin dashboards and developer tools (like the ones we've built!), Node.js is my go-to for agility and a rich ecosystem.
*(React, Next.js, Vue, Web APIs, Tooling)*

#### **The Native Experience (Swift)**
To bring my services directly into the user's hands. I use Swift to create beautiful, intuitive, and seamless native iOS applications, ensuring the best possible user experience on Apple platforms.
*(iOS & iPadOS App Development)*
