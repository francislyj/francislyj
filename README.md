# Hi, I'm Francis ðŸ‘‹

I'm an independent software creator and freelance engineer, focused on turning ambitious ideas into finished digital products. My philosophy is product-first: I architect and build systems that are not just functional, but also scalable and a pleasure to use.

### What I Build

I architect and build the full picture, from the core engine to the final user experience:

-   **Resilient & Scalable Backends:** I craft the powerful, reliable core of a product, typically using **Go**.
-   **Intelligent Data Layers:** I build the brains of the operation, using **Python** to uncover insights and power smart features.
-   **Modern Web Experiences:** I create fast, interactive web apps and dashboards with **Node.js/TypeScript**.
-   **Seamless Native Apps:** I deliver the product directly into users' hands with beautiful, native **iOS** apps.

I'm always looking to collaborate on exciting ventures or help bring a founder's vision to life.
